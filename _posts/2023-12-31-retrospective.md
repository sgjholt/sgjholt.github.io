## Last year was packed with milestones:

1. It was my 3rd consecutive year as an industry ds!

2. I started my second consecutive year at my last job!

3. I aced my first industry review, and got my first raise!

4. I deployed my first DS model into production!

5. I managed (end to end) my first model expansion project!

6. I deepened my practical skills using; `Python`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `SQL`, `Azure Cloud Infra.`, `Infra-as-code`, `PySpark`, `Databricks Platform`, `Powershell`, `Octopus Deploy`, `Azure DevOps`, `GitHub Actions`, `Docker`, `Kubernetes`, `Adobe Airflow`, `Polars`, `MLFlow`, `FastAPI`, `Streamlit`, `PowerBI`, `GitHub Co-Pilot`, `Pytorch Geometric` and so, so, much more! 

_But ..._

7. __It the first time I have ever been through layoffs!__ üòø

## Sept. (2023): I survived 4 rounds of layoffs, before it was my turn...

It was ... well ... very hard. I have been in education, or had a job, consistently since __2012__. This was new territory for me, and as much as I told myself it wasn't my fault; it still hurt. I still had questions, and personal doubts:

- _"What could I have done better?"_ 
- _"Why me?"_
- _"Did I do something wrong?"_
- _"How will I find a new job in a down market?!"_

I was fortunate to have people to support me, talk to, and rely on to help me navigate those first three questions. That last question, still troubles me.

### _"How will I find a new job in a down market?"_

__Week 1 Post-Layoff__

1. While it was still fresh, I wrote down __EVERYTHING__ I did at my last job.

2. I updated my resume, and revised it multiple times, then got feedback and revisions from a professional.

3. I wrote down what I wanted from my next job, e.g.,
    - Industry: Video Games, Insurance, Finance, Tech, Logistics, etc.
    - Job title: Data Scientist, Senior Data Scientist
    - Base Comp: For example, $130k to $140k 

4. I applied for some 'low-hanging fruit' opportunities to test my resume

5. I took a _long_ break

## Oct. (2023): I needed a break, and I was lucky enough to be able to take one.

I was fortunate that I could take time off. I raced to get all of my knowledge on paper before I did this. This was intentional, so that when I was ready to go back, all of my material was there. I made sure my resume was field tested, and was getting responses, BEFORE my break also. This gave me some peace-of-mind, so I could take at least a few weeks of meaningful time off. 

## Nov. (2023): Let the search üîé, begin!

I began applying in bursts, sending out applications, seeing responses, and then making small adjustments to my resume to improve my hit rate. I eventually found a good balance, and by the end of the month I was interviewing!

In the meantime, I was also working on some up-skilling:
- I decided to recreate this website, but using `FastAPI` and `React JS`

## Dec. (2023) | Interviewing & 'Up Skilling' 

### Up skilling

#### Prototyping the Front End üòÉ
I made lots of good progress, on my new website. By the beginning of the month, I had managed to build the front end, with all of the pages, but they were all still using dummy data from the backend API.

#### Developing the Back End ‚ò†Ô∏è
I decided early on, I wanted to learn how to use `SQLAlchemy`, and leverage `ORM` patterns to build my own `CRUD` interfaces. As I had __ZERO__ web dev experience, this proved to be challenging, I ended up rewriting this code several times. Not to mention, I decided midway to use `Pydantic`, resulting in more learning, and another refactor!

Then, in my infinite wisdom, once I had the `SQlite` database working nicely with my `CRUD` patterns (including data validation). I said: 

üí° _"Wow, this is great. But, what if I wanted to restrict access to certain routes to only people with certain privileges, like on azure portal!"_

So then, I had to learn about auth, JWT tokens, encryption ... I managed to get all of this working, then I got burned out on it. Moral of the story, feature creep is real. I will go back to this project, but I needed a break. Plus, at the time I was interviewing more, and doing take-home challenges, so I had to switch up priorities.

### Holiday Break and just-before-New Years resolution!

My remaining interviews were on hold over the break. So I decided to take a break too. At least, a break from thinking about work prep, and up-skilling. 

I learned a lot in 2023. A LOT! But, I felt myself not always enjoying what I was doing. So, I decided this time, if I was going to learn something new, it had to satisfy at least one other aspect of my life, other than professional.

Anybody who knows me, knows that aside from a science nerd ü§ì (of which I am a gigantic one), I am also a huge technology üñ•Ô∏è nerd, and I __love__ video games. I also like to build things, whether physical (like my PC), or digital. 

This time, I wanted to marry my passions for science, tech, and programming. So I decided, I was going to learn how to build video games üéÆ in my spare time.
