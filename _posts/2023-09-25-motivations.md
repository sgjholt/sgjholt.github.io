## Hello there! 

Since this web framework nicely lends itself to a blog, I decided to write a little 
blog post, outlining the reasons why I created this website in the first place! 

1. _I had never written a website before, and wanted to challenge myself to learn something new._
    - I had never used Jekyll (built on the Ruby language)
    - I had never used GitHub pages
    - I have never taken a class on web design 
      - I think is quite obvious, judging by the simplicity of this website ðŸ˜‚

2. _I wanted to showcase my technical skills and ability to learn new things independently_
    - I built my website over a few sporadic working sessions
    - I probably spent a total of 4 hours including reading the documentation

3. _I felt like, as a professional data scientist, having a nice place to showcase my work was important_
    - It seems that I'm not alone in feeling this way
    - Portfolio websites are becoming more and more common
    - I have always wanted to do this, but never had the time

I very much intend to keep building out this website in bits and pieces, and if you're reading this, I hope you find the journey at at least mildly entertaining!

In the future I would like to add some pages that showcase actual projects. I may even try to bake in a page that serves a machine learning model, but I need to learn more about what is possible with Jekyll and GitHub Pages before I can do that.

In the meantime, I have added a page that shows off [my resume]({{ '/resume/' | relative_url }}).

Cheers,
James H.
