# Welcome!

 I am a data scientist with 2+ years of industry experience, and I hold a Ph.D. in Geophysics from the University of Liverpool. I graduated in 2019, and have since worked as a researcher and data scientist. I endeavour to keep adding content to this website over time. I am constantly teaching myself new things (such as building a website with Jekyll :rocket:) and I hope to be able to share some of them with you!

## About me
My passion for data science stems from my curiosity about the natural phenomena that shape our planet and the data that can help us comprehend them better. That’s why I obtained a Ph.D. in geophysics, where I investigated seismic waves and their interactions with the Earth’s structure. I utilized Python and MATLAB to process and examine large datasets of seismic recordings (digital time series) from around the world. As a researcher, I authored three peer-reviewed publications in reputable journals.

After completing my degree, I joined a leading seismological observatory as a researcher (University of Utah Seismograph Stations), where I continued to work on seismic data analysis and earthquake magnitude modeling. I cooperated with other scientists from the USGS, AFRL, LLNL, and other institutions to enhance our understanding of earthquake hazards and risks.

I then decided to switch gears and explore other domains where data science can make an impact. I joined Bayer crop sciences as a data scientist, where I worked on models that forecast corn seed yield given historic growth and other agronomic factors. I used Python, SQL, and Domino to manipulate and explore large datasets of crop measurements, weather data, soil data, and satellite imagery. I constructed the predictive models using scikit-learn.

My most recent position was working as a Data Scientist at Coyote Logistics, which is a 3PL service provider where I work on sophisticated predictive models that estimate potential distributions of market cost for a given load of freight. I use Python, SQL (and noSQL), and Databricks to ingest and transform data from various sources such as carriers, shippers, brokers, and thi
