# Welcome!

 I am a data scientist with 2+ years of industry experience, and I hold a Ph.D. in Geophysics from the University of Liverpool. I graduated in 2019, and have since worked as a researcher and data scientist. I endeavour to keep adding content to this website over time. I am constantly teaching myself new things (such as building a website with Jekyll ðŸš€) and I hope to be able to share some of them with you!

## About me
<div>
  <p>
    My passion for data science stems from my curiosity about the natural phenomena that shape our planet and the data that can help us comprehend them better. Thatâ€™s why I obtained a Ph.D. in geophysics, where I investigated seismic waves and their interactions with the Earthâ€™s structure. I utilized Python and MATLAB to process and examine large datasets of seismic recordings (digital time series) from around the world. As a researcher, I authored three peer-reviewed publications in reputable journals ...

      <br><br>
      After completing my degree, I joined a leading seismological observatory as a researcher (University of Utah Seismograph Stations), where I continued to work on seismic data analysis and earthquake magnitude modeling. I cooperated with other scientists from the USGS, AFRL, LLNL, and other institutions to enhance our understanding of earthquake hazards and risks.
      <br><br>
      I then decided to switch gears and explore other domains where data science can make an impact. I joined Bayer crop sciences as a data scientist, where I worked on models that forecast corn seed yield given historic growth and other agronomic factors. I used Python, SQL, and Domino to manipulate and explore large datasets of crop measurements, weather data, soil data, and satellite imagery. I constructed the predictive models using scikit-learn.
      <br><br>
      My most recent position was working as a Data Scientist at Coyote Logistics, which is a 3PL service provider where I worked on sophisticated predictive models that estimate potential distributions of market cost for a given load of freight. I use Python, SQL (and noSQL), and Databricks to ingest and transform data from various sources such as carriers, shippers, brokers, and third-party APIs. I also used LightGBM, scikit-learn, and PyTorch to build and fit models that capture the uncertainty and variability of the freight market.

      <br><br>
      I was one of two hiring managers that brought him in to the team and he reported to me for the past five months. I wholeheartedly endorse him for any data science role that requires advanced analytical capabilities and the ability to productionize machine learning models into real-world applications.
      <br><br>
      James is a consummate professional with a profound knowledge of data science principles and an impressive research background demonstrated by his PhD. His academic journey underscores his dedication to mastering complex data analysis techniques, statistical modeling, and machine learning algorithms. This academic foundation has equipped him with a deep understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of data science, which he skillfully applies in practical scenarios.
      <br><br>
      What truly sets James apart is his proficiency in taking machine learning models from the development phase to production both on prem and in the cloud. He has consistently showcased an ability to bridge the gap between data science research and real-world implementation, serving up pricing predictions in real-time via API. He has also employed his data engineering skills to create data pipelines.
      <br><br>
      James has a demonstrated track record of delivering tangible results. He excels in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection to build models that not only perform well in controlled environments but also maintain their efficacy in real-world, dynamic settings. His proficiency in model deployment and monitoring ensures that the impact of his work is sustained over time. He deployed multiple versions of pricing models in parallel, including a digital twin, in order to test changes in a live environment.
      <br><br>
      James is an effective communicator and collaborator. He can convey complex technical concepts in a manner that is understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. He met regularly with business stakeholders to obtain buy-in for model roll outs. His collaborative approach fosters teamwork, facilitates knowledge sharing, and encourages cross-functional cooperation, all of which are invaluable in a fast-paced data-driven environment. James led daily standups for the spot pricing team which included data scientists and MLOPs engineers, and collaborated with product and software engineering teams."
      <br><br>
      I strongly recommend James. He will make an invaluable asset to any organization. James was a delight to work with as he is eager to learn new tools and technologies, he is very coachable, works well under pressure, delivers on time and is always striving to grow and improve.

      James possesses a unique blend of technical expertise and communication skills that sets him apart in the field.
      <br><br>
      One of James' standout qualities is his remarkable ability to explain complex concepts in a way that is both clear and accessible. When I recently joined the new project, I often found myself turning to James for explanation, and he consistently impressed me with his knack for making even the most intricate data science topics easy to understand. His patience and willingness to mentor others speak volumes about his dedication to fostering a collaborative and supportive work environment.
      <br><br>
      James is not only a fantastic communicator but also incredibly organized when it comes to documentation. In a field where clarity and precision are important, his commitment to maintaining comprehensive and well-structured documentation has been instrumental in our project's success. His organized approach not only streamlines our work processes but also ensures that valuable insights and knowledge are readily accessible to the entire team.
      <br><br>
      As someone who was just starting my career in data science, James was an invaluable mentor and role model to me. His passion for the field, coupled with his unwavering commitment to excellence, motivated me to strive for greater heights in my own work. James truly embodies the spirit of a data scientist who not only excels technically but also uplifts those around him.
      <br><br>
      I have no doubt that James will continue to demonstrate his brightness in whatever environment he is in, and I'd recommend him for any data science role. He is not only a skilled professional but also a genuinely wonderful person to work with. It was an honor to work alongside James, and I look forward to seeing his continued success in the future.
